## Add Missing Artboard Features to Figma

`openplugin` is a powerful Figma plugin designed to streamline your workflow when dealing with multiple artboards (Figma Frames) of similar or inconsistent sizes. It provides two core functionalities: quickly finding artboards with identical dimensions and precisely correcting the size of a group of similarly sized artboards.

Whether you're trying to standardize your design files or quickly locate all screens of a specific breakpoint, `openplugin` helps you maintain consistency and efficiency.

## Features

`openplugin` offers two distinct modes to help you manage your artboards:

1.  ### Find Similar Artboards

    - **Purpose**: Instantly select all top-level frames on your current page that have the **exact same width and height** as a selected reference frame.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for quickly isolating all screens of a specific device size (e.g., all iPhone X artboards) or finding duplicates.
    - **How it works**:
      1.  Select any frame on your canvas.
      2.  Run the plugin and choose "Find Similar Artboards".
      3.  All frames on the current page that exactly match the dimensions of your selected frame will be automatically selected and zoomed into view.

2.  ### Correct Artboard Size
    - **Purpose**: Identify frames with dimensions similar to a selected reference frame (within a 10px tolerance) and then batch resize them to new, specified dimensions.
    - **Use Case**: Perfect for standardizing slightly off-sized artboards, updating a set of screens to a new responsive breakpoint, or fixing minor inconsistencies across your file.
    - **How it works**:
      1.  Run the plugin and choose "Correct Artboard Size".
      2.  **Step 1: Select Reference Frame**: Select a frame on your canvas that represents the dimensions you want to match against. Click "Continue".
      3.  **Step 2: Enter New Dimensions**: The plugin will show you the dimensions of your selected reference frame. Enter the desired new `Width` and `Height` for the matching artboards.
      4.  **Step 3: Preview Changes**: Click "Preview Changes" to see a list of all frames that will be affected (those within Â±10px of your reference frame's original dimensions). Each item will show its current dimensions and the new dimensions it will be resized to.
      5.  **Step 4: Apply Changes**: If the preview looks correct, click "Apply Changes" to resize all listed frames.

## Installation
